# Group Members Feature

## Overview
This feature allows users to view group members by clicking on the group icon in the chat window header.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created GroupMembersModal Component
**File:** `src/components/modals/GroupMembersModal.tsx`

A new modal component that displays:
- Group name and member count
- List of all group members with their avatars
- Online status indicators
- Member usernames and emails
- Loading states and error handling
- Retry functionality on errors

**Key Features:**
- Fetches group members from backend API endpoint: `/api/groups/{groupId}/members`
- Handles different response formats (array or paginated)
- Shows online status with green indicators
- Responsive design with proper mobile support
- Smooth animations and hover effects

### 2. Updated ChatWindow Component
**File:** `src/components/ChatWindow.tsx`

**Changes:**
1. Added import for `GroupMembersModal`
2. Added state: `showGroupMembers` to control modal visibility
3. Made group icon clickable:
   - Added `cursor-pointer` class for groups
   - Added `onClick` handler to open modal
   - Added hover effects (ring color change)
   - Added tooltip "View group members"
4. Rendered `GroupMembersModal` at the end of component

**User Interaction:**
- Click on the group icon (ðŸ‘¥) in the chat header
- Modal appears showing all group members
- Click outside modal or close button to dismiss

### 3. Updated Modals Index
**File:** `src/components/modals/index.ts`

Added export for `GroupMembersModal` to make it available throughout the app.

## API Integration

The component expects the backend to provide an endpoint:
```
GET /api/groups/{groupId}/members
```

**Expected Response Format:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "user-id",
    "username": "username",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "avatarUrl": "https://...",
    "isOnline": true
  }
]
```

Or paginated format:
```json
{
  "content": [...],
  "members": [...]
}
```

## UI/UX Features

1. **Visual Feedback:**
   - Cursor changes to pointer on hover (groups only)
   - Ring color transitions on hover
   - Tooltip shows "View group members"

2. **Modal Design:**
   - Clean, modern interface
   - Scrollable member list
   - Member avatars with initials fallback
   - Online status indicators (green dot)
   - Responsive layout for mobile devices

3. **Loading States:**
   - Spinner while fetching data
   - Error message with retry button
   - Empty state message

4. **Accessibility:**
   - ARIA labels for screen readers
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Click outside to close
   - Proper focus management

## Future Enhancements

3. Member actions (message, view profile)
4. Search/filter members
5. Sort members by online status
6. Show member join date
7. Export member list

## Browser Support

Works on all modern browsers:

## Notes

- The group icon is only clickable for group chats (not 1-on-1 chats)
- Backend API endpoint must be implemented for this to work
- Member data is fetched fresh each time the modal opens
- No caching implemented yet (can be added for performance)
